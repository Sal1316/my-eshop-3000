# My eShop 3000

## Description

- This application was created out of the need to gain practical application experience in creating models, routing, and seeding using Sequelize and mysql2. In this application, we need to create tables in the database that we are going to access and alter the information. We used Sequelize to create code in which we can seed the tables and edit the info in the tables. The result of all of these processes working together is a fully functioning back-end database app. It can be used for a variety of purposes, but the target is to keep track of supplies. For example, an e-commerce website might use this information to keep track of their inventory.

## Installation

- Installation is fairly simple. All you would need to do is clone a copy of the repo into your local environment. After that is done, you can open it up and run 'npm i' to install the dependencies. Now your app is installed and ready for whatever you want.

## Usage

- To use this app, you would need to change the routes in the URL to match what you have in your route paths for their respective API. Insomnia is what we used to test that the endpoints are working and are able to generate some data. If you were to use Insomnia, make CRUD operation calls to each of the Categories, Products, and Tags pages. Once you have performed the CRUD operations, you are able to access all the endpoints and retrieve, post, edit, and delete whatever data you want.
